lightweight programming language

object orientated and event driven
    -everything happens in the form of events

not related to java except for name and some syntax
    -automatic semicolon insertion



event driven code
    -js has no main
    -they only respond to browser and user actions(events)

events 
    -basically anything that happens on the page

how it works
    -code that responds to something happening
        -i.e. button press = event -> run code -> change page based on code

how to make things responsive
    -figure out what element should be responsive and what should happening
    -write a js script that will execute what you want to run
    -attach function to the event

Document Object Model
    -DOM is an API where js programmers can access and manipulate html elements in code
    -check element's state(is checked or not)
    -change state of elements(insert text into a div)
    -change styles of elements(make the text red)
    -every HTML object can be seen by DOM
       <img> src="foo" ald ="foo1" id="foo2"
       can use document.getelementbyid(id) to get the element
