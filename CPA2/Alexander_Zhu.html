                    <dt>12 Years a slave</dt>
                    <dd>What I really liked about this story is Solomon Northup's resilience and depiction as a person who never lost his self respect for himself.</dd>
                    <dt>Beloved</dt>
                    <dd>I'm honestly surprised I never read stuff by Toni Morrison sooner, it's inspired me to read more of her work.</dd>
                    <dt>Gun Island</dt>
                    <dd>This is a story by Amita Ghosh and it combines a lot of really mysterious supernatural elements with some realist ones to make a very cool contrast</dd>
