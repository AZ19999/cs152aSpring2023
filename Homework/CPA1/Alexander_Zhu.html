        <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Some of the things I like to do outside of classes involve reading and writing. I'll put a list of some books that I've recently that I feel like need highligthing</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>12 Years a slave</dt>
            <dd>What I really liked about this story is Solomon Northup's resilience and depiction as a person who never lost his self respect for himself.</dd>
            <dt>Beloved</dt>
            <dd>I'm honestly surprised I never read stuff by Toni Morrison sooner, it's inspired me to read more of her work.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Another hobby that I picked up recently was playing trading card games, specifically Magic: The gathering. I really like the strategic element and the wide variety of cards which allowed me to find my playstyle</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here is my favorite card! You can click the image to see more details about it!</p>

        <p>Lastly, I've always been pretty interested in gaming. It's a little nerdy, but I actually made a montage last year, you can find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkHvLIt4LyU">here.</a> It's nothing that impressive, but I'm proud of it nonetheless.</p>

        <p>Here is a list of some of my favorite games</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Counter Strike</li>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>Warframe</li>
            <li>Destiny 2</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>That was a little bit about me! Obviously I didn't cover every little detail so if you want to talk more, I'm always happy to talk about whatever you want!</p>
